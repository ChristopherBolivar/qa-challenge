<h1>Creating Api</h1>
<p>In the seeds file located in /server/bin I created a for loop iterating 100 times, pushing objects with 2 keys of "id" and "name" into an empty array. I then write the server-side script to create the collection using the "App" model. I then run the the node command "node bin/seeds" to seed the data generated to a Mongo Database.
